# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis-using-Microsoft-Excel


## 🎯 Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze retail sales data to uncover actionable insights that improve the Coffee Shop’s performance by optimizing product offerings, identifying peak sales periods, and understanding customer purchasing behavior.

## 🧩 Business Problem
The coffee shop chain lacks detailed visibility into its sales performance across different locations, time periods, and product categories. Without actionable insights, the business struggles to:
- Identify which products drive the most revenue.
- Understand customer buying patterns (what, when, and where they purchase).
- Optimize inventory and staffing based on demand fluctuations.
- Improve marketing and promotional strategies
This lack of insight hinders data-driven decision-making and affects overall profitability and operational efficiency.
